The Quick Start sets up the following:
? A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
? A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to
provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
? In the public subnets:
– Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
– A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell
(SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
? A Network Load Balancer attached to the public subnets connecting via port 443 to the
NGINX container, providing reverse proxy and Secure Sockeets Layer (SSL) termination
for the Artifactory primary and secondary nodes listening on port 8081.
? In the private subnets:
– An Amazon RDS instance accessible only from the private subnets on port 3306.
Amazon Web Services – Artifactory with Amazon ECS on the AWS Cloud September 2019
– Two Amazon ECS service groups, one for the primary node, and the other for the
secondaries.
– Artifactory and NGINX containers.
– An Auto Scaling group configured specifically to boot instances ready to host
Artifactory.
? A private and encrypted S3 bucket for repository storage.
