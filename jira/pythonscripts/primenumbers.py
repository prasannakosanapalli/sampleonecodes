#Python program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval
#Given two positive integer start and end. The task is to write a Python program toprint all Prime numbers in an Interval.
#Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.

                if (val % n) == 0:
                    break
            else:
                c.append(val)
