#Python program to check whether a number is Prime or not
#Given a positive integer N. The task is to write a Python program to check if the number is prime or not.
#Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and #itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.
